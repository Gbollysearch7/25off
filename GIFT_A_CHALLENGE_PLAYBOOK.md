WHAT IS GIFT-A-CHALLENGE (FEB 9 - 18)
Gift-a-Challenge is a Valentines promotion where traders buy any challenge (CFD or Futures) at 25% off and automatically receive a unique gift code they can send to someone else. The gift recipient gets a FREE lower-tier challenge account.

It turns every purchase into two accounts: one paid (discounted) and one gifted (free). This doubles our user acquisition per transaction while giving the buyer a reason to share TradersYard with a partner, friend, or mentee.

The Customer Journey

Trader buys ANY challenge using code LOVE25 (gets 25% off)
After purchase, trader receives a unique gift code via email

Both traders are now active on TradersYard

Risk Control Summary
Gift accounts are always a LOWER tier than what the buyer purchased. The gift tier shown above is a suggestion - final mapping is up to Manuel. The key principle: we never give away the same tier or higher for free.

Items Pending CEO Approval
This is another form of giveaway but tactical because only people who have committed to buying can have access to it. And also we can assume that a trader in their circle that will get the giveaway will have a profile to turn into a paying customer once they're in our ecosystem.
I need approval for the Gift mapping, if it's okay.
I intend to create a website for landing pages for this campaign that will have the details. This will reduce the load on customer contacting support to ask questions.
Let me know if we should have added rules or restrictions e.g how many they can buy during the campaign?
