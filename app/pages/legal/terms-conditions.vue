			      5. Virtual accounts and their use
		      </h2>

		      <div class="space-y-4">
			      <p>
				      "Virtual trading" refers to trading with virtual money in a simulated trading environment. It is a way for traders and investors to practice and execute their skills and strategies without actually risking real money. The only risk the user has to bear is the participation fee for each TRADERSYARD challenge booked.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      In a virtual trading game, participants receive a virtual balance that they can use to buy and sell securities. The price movements of the securities are based on actual market conditions, giving participants the opportunity to execute their trading strategies in a realistic environment without losing or gaining real money.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      In Challenge Levels 1 to 3, the participant's transactions are executed exclusively on virtual accounts. Participants act as signal providers for TRADERSYARD, which reserves the right to execute or ignore these signals on its own challenge and asset class-specific real accounts in a cooperation company licensed for this purpose, at its own discretion.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      If you participate in virtual trading on any of the available trading platforms (AgenaTrader), you have the authority to conduct virtual transactions, with the exception of trading strategies or practices that fall under the prohibited category described in clause "Prohibited Gambling Activities" below. It is also your responsibility to comply with standard market regulations and practices for trading in the financial markets, including risk management. Please also note that the trading conditions you choose may impose certain restrictions on the trading platform or that TRADERSYARD may impose certain risk settings which you as a User may not override.

In the Pay-Out Levels, users act as signal providers, whereby TRADERSYARD decides whether to execute or ignore these trades on the real money accounts of the licensed cooperation company based on various risk analyses, which are evaluated, among other things, from the trading activities of Levels 1 to Level 3 of the user.

			      <p>

		      </h2>

		      <div class="space-y-4">
			      <p>
				      If your trading strategy violates any of the rules below, we reserve the right to investigate and take necessary action, which may include suspending your account.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      During the period of virtual trading within the Challenges, it is strictly forbidden to use trading strategies that knowingly or unknowingly exploit errors in the service, such as inaccurate price displays or delayed updates.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      Likewise, it is strictly prohibited to trade with an external or delayed data feed or to engage in any form of trading activity - alone or in collaboration with others, including through linked accounts or accounts held with different TRADERSYARD affiliates - with the intention of manipulating trading, e.g. through simultaneous opposite positions.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      It is also prohibited to execute trades contrary to the terms and conditions of TRADERSYARD or the trading platform used.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      It is expressly forbidden to purchase services or grant 3rd party companies access to the user's accounts that carry out virtual trading on behalf of the challenge participant.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      The use of software, artificial intelligence, ultra-high-speed tools (high-frequency trading) or mass data entry that could be used to manipulate or exploit our systems or services or to gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      It is strictly prohibited to execute trades that are inconsistent with the manner in which trading on any of the financial markets provided to TRADERSYARD is conducted in a legally correct manner or in a manner that gives rise to a reasonable concern that the Client's activities may result in financial or other harm to TRADERSYARD.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      In addition, the client is expected not to take advantage of the services by entering into transactions without applying standard risk management practices for trading on the financial markets. These practices include, among other things, the risk management specified in the TRADERSYARD Challenges, tricky to circumvent with too high positions (lucky shots).
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      TRADERSYARD reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, whether certain trades, practices, strategies or situations constitute prohibited trade practices.

				      6.1 Effects
			      </h3>

			      <p>
				      In the event that a customer engages in any of the prohibited trade practices, TRADERSYARD reserves the right to take the following actions:
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      * this shall be deemed a violation of the terms and conditions of the respective TRADERSYARD Challenge
				      <br>
				      * remove any transactions that violate the prohibition from the client's trading history and/or exclude their results from the profits and/or losses generated by virtual trading, and/or
				      <br>
				      * immediately terminate all services provided to the customer and subsequently terminate this contract.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      In the event that one or more Prohibited Trading Practices are detected on one or more TRADERSYARD Challenge Accounts of a Client or on Challenge Accounts of different Clients or by the combination of trades across one or more TRADERSYARD Challenge Accounts, TRADERSYARD reserves the right to cancel all Services and terminate all relevant Contracts in respect of all TRADERSYARD Accounts of the Client. TRADERSYARD may take any action referred to in this Agreement as it deems appropriate.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      Engaging in prohibited trade practices or using TRADERSYARD Challenge Accounts for such activities may result in a violation of the terms and conditions for such accounts with potential Third Party Providers. Consequently, the third party provider may also terminate the relevant agreements and delete all associated user accounts.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      In the event that the Client continues to engage in any of the Prohibited Trade Practices despite prior notification by TRADERSYARD, TRADERSYARD reserves the right to deny the Client access to all or certain parts of the Services, including the User Dashboard and the Trading Platform, without any compensation. In this case, the Client shall not be entitled to a refund of any fees paid.

				      6.2 Exclusion of responsibility for trading or investment activities
			      </h3>

			      <p class="underline">
				      TRADERSYARD cannot accept responsibility for any trading or investment activities undertaken by the Client outside of the existing relationship. This includes any use of data or information from the user dashboard, the trading platform or any other source in connection with the services offered for actual trading on the financial markets. This applies even if the Client uses the same trading platform for both virtual and actual trading purposes. TRADERSYARD shall not be responsible for any third party services accessed by the Client via the Platform, including webinars.
			      </p>

			      <p class="underline">
				      The financial markets are subject to frequent and abrupt changes, which can make trading in these markets unprofitable and lead to significant financial losses. It is important to note that previous successes and profits achieved by the client during virtual trading are not a guarantee or indication of future developments or results during live trading.

			      <p>
				      After the payment of the fee for the TRADERSYARD Challenge, the client will receive his access data for the trading platform via the e-mail address he has provided or the user dashboard. It should be noted that the activation of the TRADERSYARD Challenge is subject to the payment of the relevant fee. If the Client is a consumer, the Client expressly requests TRADERSYARD to provide the Services before the end of the withdrawal period by opening the first Virtual Trading Account. The User decides himself when he starts virtual trading in the Challenge Accounts.

				      7.2 Descriptions of the challenges
			      </h3>

			      <p>
				      Example course of the $5000 Challenge:
			      </p>

			      <ul class="pl-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
				      <li>
					      The user starts at level 1
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      Each level is assigned a certain amount of the maximum account size.
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      When the profit target is reached, the user advances to the next level and receives an account with a higher virtual account balance ("Virtual Account Size")
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      If the cash value minus the open P&L of a challenge account has reached the daily loss limit or the level loss limit of this level, all your trades will be closed and your challenge will be marked as failed. You can continue to trade your challenge if you purchase an account reset. More information on how to reset your account can be found
					      <a href="https://docs.tradersyard.com/traderchallenge/faqs#how-can-i-reset-my-account" target="_blank">here</a>.
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      As soon as level 3 is reached, the trader qualifies for real money payouts (more details to follow) and has the right to request a payout as soon as the trader reaches Level 4
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      From level 3, the user acts as a potential signal provider, for which a work contract is concluded with the user as soon as Level 4 will be reached.
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      TradersYard is authorized (but not obligated) to replicate these trades on the proprietary prop trading account in order to participate in these signals.
				      </li>
			      </ul>

			      <p>
				      The aforementioned parameters and their individual steps are explained in more detail at www.tradersyard.com under the heading "Challenges" and at www.docs.tradersyard.com.

				      7.3 Further rules for fulfilling/completing a challenge level and transitioning to higher/lower levels
			      </h3>

			      <p>
				      There is no time limit on when the user has to start trading or how long they have to stay in a level. The user remains in the challenge until he has either reached level 10 in the profit target or has breached a loss limit (daily or level loss) for the open loss amount.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      If the customer has reached the profit target of his respective level above the closed trades, his account is temporarily blocked, all his current trades are closed and his orders are deleted. The customer is informed of this by e-mail and this fact is also displayed in his user dashboard. The system then checks whether the user may have violated the "Prohibited trade activities" paragraph or other challenge rules.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      If a trader has reached a payout level, he must wait until he receives confirmation of the payout, only then may he continue trading. If he continues trading before this, the trades are invalid and he may have to start the level from the beginning.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      In order to be able to advance to a higher level, the following rules must also be observed, which are listed at https://docs.tradersyard.com/traderchallenge/rules-for-traderchallenge:
			      </p>

			      <ul class="pl-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
				      <li>
					      Each level has specific margin limits which can be reduced from 100% margin utilization per trade in level 1 to 10% margin limitation per trade. You can find the specific values of the margin limits on our website.
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      At least 15 trades must have been closed
				      </li>
			      </ul>

			      <p>
				      If this check is positive, i.e. in the trader's favor, the user is assigned the virtual account size and the risk parameters of the next level, with which the user starts again at this level.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      If the check is negative, the effects of the "Prohibited trade activities" paragraph apply. Checks within the meaning of "Prohibited trade activities" are also carried out continuously during trading activities within a level.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      However, if the daily risk limit or the absolute level risk limit is reached, the challenge is terminated, all trades are automatically closed, the orders are deleted, the challenge is blocked and the status of the challenge is set to "failed".
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      The trader now has the option to buy back into the challenge via a reset and start again with Level 1.

		      </h2>

		      <div class="space-y-4">
			      <p>
				      By paying the participation fee for a TradersYard Tournament (or by clicking the button for free entry in the case of free tournaments), a participation agreement between TradersYard and the User is formed. The right of withdrawal and a possible refund of the participation fee for Tournaments expires at the start of the Tournament, even if the User has not yet made any trades.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      If a User has won a Tournament, the User can only claim the prize if the User successfully completes the KYC/AML process following the Tournament.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      Cash redemption of won goods and rewards is excluded.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      Participation in TradersYard Tournaments is permitted from the age of 18 years.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      If the competition is a sponsored tournament (e.g. Survivor Showdown), then by participating in the competition, the user agrees to the sharing of user data with the Showdown sponsors.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      Participants from the USA, Canada, as well as from any countries listed on the U.S. sanctions list, are not allowed. (This includes, but is not limited to: Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and other restricted jurisdictions as per the current U.S. sanctions list.)
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      Tournament Prizes & Rewards are non-transferable. In order to withdraw prizes in cash, you must successfully finish our KYC. Winners are responsible for providing their accurate information for transmission of funds. Any and all prize-related expenses, including without limitation any and all federal, state, and/or local income and withholding taxes shall be the sole responsibility of the winner. No substitution of prize or transfer/assignment of prize to others is permitted. Acceptance of prize constitutes permission for the Company to use the winner's name, likeness, and entry for purposes of advertising and trade without further compensation, unless prohibited by law.
			      </p>

			      <p>
				      You may not enter a tournament multiple times - indicated by using multiple email addresses, identities, or devices in an attempt to circumvent the Tournament Rules. If you use fraudulent methods or otherwise attempt to circumvent the Tournament Rules, your submission may be removed from eligibility at the sole discretion of the Company. In the event of a dispute over who submitted an entry, unless facts and circumstances cause the Company to decide otherwise, the entry will be deemed submitted by the authorized account holder of the email address submitted at the time of entry. “Authorized account holder” is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an account by an Internet access Company, online service Company, or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for the email account.

				      12.1 KYC Overview
			      </h3>

			      <p>
				      To comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) requirements, we implement a Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This process helps us verify the identity of our users, assess potential risks, and ensure the integrity of our platform. KYC procedures are applied to all users who engage in activities that require identity verification, such as participating in trading challenges, accessing premium features, or conducting transactions above certain thresholds as determined by applicable regulations. We utilize Veriff
				      <a href="https://veriff.com">(www.veriff.com)</a>, a trusted third-party provider, to facilitate secure and efficient KYC verification, requiring users to submit government-issued identification documents to pass the verification process.
			      </p>

			      <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
				      12.2 When Full Verification is Required
			      </h3>

			      <p>
				      Full KYC verification is required in the following circumstances:
			      </p>

			      <ul class="pl-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
				      <li>
					      When a user advances to the "funded level" in our trading challenges, at which point they must complete the KYC process before proceeding further.
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      When a user engages in financial transactions exceeding a specified threshold, as mandated by applicable laws.
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      When there is reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity, misuse of the platform, or non-compliance with our Terms and Conditions.
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      When required by regulatory authorities or to comply with legal obligations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
				      </li>
			      </ul>

			      <p>
				      Users will be notified via email or through the platform interface when full verification is required. Specifically, upon reaching the funded level in our trading challenges, users will be prompted to complete the KYC process. This verification must be successfully completed before any potential payouts can be processed. If a user fails to pass the KYC verification, payouts will not be possible, and any associated Signal-Provider contract with the user will be canceled.
			      </p>

			      <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
				      12.3 Verification Process and Data Handling
			      </h3>

			      <p>
				      To complete the KYC process, users must submit a clear, valid copy of a government-issued identification document, such as a passport, driver’s license, or national ID card, through Veriff’s secure platform. In some cases, additional documentation, such as proof of address (e.g., a utility bill or bank statement), may be requested. The verification process includes the following steps:
			      </p>

			      <ul class="pl-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
				      <li><strong>Submission</strong>: Users upload their identification documents via Veriff’s secure, encrypted portal integrated into our platform.</li>
				      <li><strong>Validation</strong>: Veriff employs advanced automated and manual verification methods to confirm the authenticity of the provided documents. This includes checking for signs of tampering, validating document details against trusted databases, and ensuring consistency with user-provided information.</li>
				      <li><strong>Data Security</strong>: All submitted data is encrypted during transmission and storage, adhering to industry-standard security protocols. Access to this data is restricted to authorized personnel only, and it is used solely for KYC verification purposes unless otherwise required by law.</li>
			      </ul>

			      <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
				      Prohibited Jurisdictions
			      </h3>

			      <p>
				      To comply with international regulations and sanctions, we maintain a list of prohibited jurisdictions. Citizens and residents of the following countries are restricted from using our services: Iran, North Korea, Myanmar, the Russian Federation, and Belarus. This list may be updated periodically to reflect changes in legal or regulatory requirements. Users attempting to register or access services from these jurisdictions will be denied access, and any accounts found to be in violation may be suspended or terminated.
			      </p>

			      <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
				      Data Retention and Privacy
			      </h3>

			      <p>

We comply with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) where relevant, to ensure user privacy.

				      13.2 Professional Trader Exclusion

				      For the purposes of these Terms, a "professional trader" includes, but is not limited to, any individual who:
			      </p>

			      <ul class="pl-6 space-y-2 list-disc">
				      <li>
					      Is registered, licensed, or otherwise authorized as a financial professional (including, but not limited to, registered investment advisers, broker-dealers, or futures commission merchants);
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      Holds professional certifications or designations in trading, investment management, or financial services (such as CFA, CMT, Series 7, or equivalent credentials);
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      Engages in trading activities as their primary source of income or profession;
				      </li>
				      <li>
					      Has been employed by a financial institution, proprietary trading firm, hedge fund, or similar entity in a trading or investment capacity within the preceding twelve (12) months; or
				      </li>

				      </li>
			      </ul>

			      <p>
				      By participating in Futures Challenges, you represent and warrant that you are a non-professional trader and do not meet any of the criteria set forth above. If TRADERSYARD determines, in its sole discretion, that a user qualifies as a professional trader, TRADERSYARD reserves the right to immediately terminate the user's participation in Futures Challenges, suspend or close the user's account, and forfeit any pending payouts or entitlements without liability.
