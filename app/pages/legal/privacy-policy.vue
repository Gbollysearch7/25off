		          Our Services allow you to stay in touch, in communication and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you will “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. When you connect, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We will use data about you (such as profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with. It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your name, photo, network and contact information. We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have choices about how we use their data.

We use the information about you to recommend relevant content across our Services, suggest skills you may have to add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or watch related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and picture, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted a blog, took a social action, made new connections or were mentioned in the news.

	          <p>
		          Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, follows, likes and comments. When you share a post (e.g., an update, video or blog), the default (which you can change) is to share it publicly. Others who are not your connections will be able to find (including through search engines) and see your post. When you like, comment on or share another’s post, others will see it, including the person who initiated the post. In a group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile unless you change the default settings. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We provide aggregate insights about the followers and viewers to the respective page owners. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable.

		          Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable such archiving outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.

When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or FaceBook account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your TradersYard GmbH/TradersYard contacts into its own service. You may revoke the link with such accounts. Subject to your settings, excerpts from your profile will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user a “mini” TradersYard GmbH/TradersYard profile of the person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). “Old” profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.

	          <p>
		          If a user comments in a blog or other posts, the IP address will be saved. This is for security reasons and ensures the safety of the provider in the case that someone posts illegal content. In such a case, the provider could be prosecuted and therefore it is necessary to identify the author.
		          Integration of third party services and contents It is possible that external contents may be used within the online presence of this website. Examples are: YouTube videos, Google maps, RSS feed, or graphics from other websites. This always requires that the providers of other contents (third party providers) are able to perceive the IP address of the user. Without the IP address it is not possible to send the contents to the user’s browser. Therefore the IP address is necessary in order to display the contents. We strive to use providers who use the IP address only for displaying contents. However, we do not have any influence and assume no responsibility or liability if the third party provider uses the IP address for statistical purposes. If we become aware of such information we will inform users.
