### SECTION 8: FAQ

**Q1:**
```
Q: What's the difference between 1-Phase and 2-Phase?
A: 1-Phase ($225) requires you to hit a 10% profit target in one go.
2-Phase ($225) splits it into 8% then 5%, which is easier for most traders.
Same price, different paths—choose what suits your style.
```

**Q2:**
```
Q: How much can I realistically make?
A: Our average funded 50K trader makes 8-12% monthly.
That's $3,200-$4,800 gross, or $2,560-$3,840 in your pocket (80% split).
Consistent, not flashy—real trading income.

### SECTION 9: FAQ

**Q1:**
```
Q: Why is the 100K your best seller?
A: Three reasons:
1. Best cost-per-capital ratio ($2.83 per $1,000)
2. Highest pass rate (71%)
3. Meaningful profit potential ($4,000-8,000/month)
It's the account where the math really works.
```

**Q2:**
```
Q: Is 100K too big for me?
A: If you can trade a 10K account profitably, you can trade 100K.
The rules are the same—just different numbers.
In fact, 100K is often EASIER because you have more room for drawdown.
```

**Q3:**
```
Q: What if I fail?
A: You can purchase a reset for $105 to try again.
Or add a free reset at checkout for just $50 (saves you $55).
Most traders who fail once pass on their second attempt.
```

**Q4:**
```
Q: How long does it take to pass?
A: Average is 14 days for both phases.
Fast traders pass in under a week.
There's no time limit, so take whatever time you need.
```

**Q5:**
```
Q: Can I scale up to 200K later?
A: Yes! Successful 100K traders can upgrade to 200K at a discounted rate.
Prove yourself at 100K first, then scale.

### SECTION 2: WHO THIS IS FOR

**Section Title:**
```
The 200K is For Serious Traders Only
```

**Warning Box:**
```
⚠️ IMPORTANT: The 200K challenge has our lowest pass rate (58%).
This is NOT a beginner account. We recommend 200K only if:
- You've been consistently profitable for 6+ months
- You're comfortable with $16,000 profit targets
- You have experience managing larger position sizes
- You've passed smaller challenges before

If you're unsure, start with the 100K. You can always upgrade later.
```

**Ideal Candidate Profile:**
```
THE 200K TRADER:
✓ 1+ years of profitable trading experience
✓ Documented track record
✓ Understands position sizing at scale
✓ Emotionally prepared for larger P&L swings
✓ Has a proven, repeatable strategy
```

### SECTION 3: PROFIT POTENTIAL

**Section Title:**
```
200K Earning Potential
```

**Earnings Table:**
```
| Monthly Return | Gross Profit | Your Share (80%) | Annual Potential |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| 5% | $10,000 | $8,000 | $96,000 |
| 10% | $20,000 | $16,000 | $192,000 |
| 15% | $30,000 | $24,000 | $288,000 |
```

**Context:**
```
At 200K, even modest returns create serious income.
A conservative 5% monthly = $8,000 in your pocket = $96K annually.
This is professional trader territory.
```

### SECTION 4: CHALLENGE RULES

**Section Title:**
```
200K Challenge Requirements
```

```

**Reality Check:**

### SECTION 6: 100K vs 200K COMPARISON

**Section Title:**
```
Should You Choose 100K or 200K?
```

**Comparison:**
```
| Factor | 100K | 200K |
|--------|------|------|
| Price | $283 | $488 |
| Phase 1 Target | $8,000 | $16,000 |
| Pass Rate | 71% | 58% |
| Monthly Potential | $4,000-8,000 | $8,000-16,000 |
| Risk Level | Moderate | Higher |
| Best For | Most traders | Experienced only |
```

**Recommendation:**
```
🎯 HONEST ADVICE:
Unless you have a proven track record, start with the 100K.
You can upgrade to 200K after you've demonstrated consistent profitability.
The 200K's lower pass rate means many traders would be better off
passing the 100K first, banking some profits, then scaling up.

```
Why Did You Fail? (Be Honest)
```

**Common Reasons:**
```
Reason 1: Rule Violation (80% of failures)

FIX: Read the rules again before you reset. Seriously.

Reason 3: Wrong Position Size

- Didn't account for spread/slippage
FIX: Use 1-2% max risk per trade. Always.
