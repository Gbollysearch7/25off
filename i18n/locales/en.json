Such results, being inherently limited, do not stem from actual trading activities and, therefore, may misrepresent the impact of real market conditions, such as liquidity. These models, often constructed with the benefit of hindsight, lack predictive value regarding future trading outcomes. It must be acknowledged that no assurance is provided that any trading account will achieve profits or losses similar to those illustrated and that risk disclosure language is seen as a vital aspect to inform potential clients of these limitations and the inherent risks involved. Furthermore, it is essential to note that testimonials included within such advertisements are not indicative of all clients' experiences and do not serve as a guarantee of future performance or success. Past performance metrics should not be interpreted as reliable indicators of future results. Compliance with these stipulations is not only a regulatory requirement but a critical measure to ensure transparency and protect potential investors from misleading representations. All advertisements must incorporate this specific disclosure language to remain compliant with CFTC Rule 4.41"

If a trader is in a loss but has not breached the account, there is still no restriction or cycle forcing them to reset - they can take as much time as needed to return to profitability and request a payout. The payout cycle only resets when a trader actually requests a payout, which means the timing remains fully in the trader's control.\n\nFor example, a trader who begins a funded account on Day 0 becomes eligible to request a payout on Day 14. If they continue trading without requesting a payout, there will not be any need of new cycle. Even by Day 45, nothing changes until they choose to request payout. If the trader decides to request a payout on Day 50, only then does the payout cycle reset once payout amount is transferred, and the next 14-day window begins from that point.\n\nFor Futures accounts, minimum payout is 1% of the initial balance."

High-frequency trading is also prohibited - the system will block more than 300 requests per minute (placing, modifying, or canceling orders).\n\n### Market Exploits\n\nTrading strategies that rely on system glitches, delayed feeds, or arbitrage are forbidden. Any attempt to manipulate prices or exploit the platform will result in account closure.\n\n### Risk Management Discipline\n\nProfit targets cannot be achieved with a single oversized trade. Traders are expected to trade consistently with proper lot sizing and stop losses, instead of reckless risk-taking.\n\n### Multiple Accounts\n\nHedging across accounts is not allowed. Opening opposite positions in different accounts, even if owned by the same person or group, will lead to disqualification.\n\n### Gambling Behavior\n\nMartingale, grid strategies, random lot sizes, or reckless scalping are considered gambling and are strictly prohibited.\n\n### Trading Style\n\nAvoid overconcentration on a single asset, heavily one-sided bets without analysis, or impulsive overtrading. A disciplined and researched approach is required.\n\nNo HFT, no exploits, no gambling strategies, no multi-account hedging - always trade with consistency and discipline."
